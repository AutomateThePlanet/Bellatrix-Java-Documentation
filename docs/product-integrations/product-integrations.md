Overview
--------
The quality assurance practices such as automated tests usually do not consist only of tools for writing or executing tests. There are multiple tools and systems involved from CI to analyzation of test results. Letâ€™s take a look at how BELLATRIX integrates with such systems.

### Allure ###
Allure Framework is a flexible, lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what has been tested in a neat web report form. Allure reports shorten common defect lifecycle: test failures can be divided into bugs and broken tests, also logs, steps, fixtures, attachments, timings, history, and integrations with TMS and bug-tracking systems.
